        <div class="intro">
            <p>With many over tens of millions e-commerce sites on the web, it's always a delite to come across a website which is well designed and developed. Although nowadays, most profesionals understand what constitues a "good" website, I think the most of us tend to take notice when comming across a site which takes things to another level.</p>
            <p>In the hopes of learning how to improve our own e-commerce site, I have had the pleasure of visiting and researching many other such sites during the past two years. Find below a selection of the three sites which I have come to love from both an UI/UX perspective.</p>
